Prepared by: [Your Name], ClearSight Ops
Date: [Date]

## 1. Executive Summary

[Company] is experiencing [specific pain point identified in discovery]. Currently, your team spends approximately [X hours/week] on manual ops reporting, and operational issues like [specific examples] are often discovered reactively.

ClearSight Ops will automate your daily operations intelligence, providing:

## 2. The Challenge

Based on our conversation on [date], [Company] faces these operational challenges:

1. **Manual Reporting**
   - [X] hours/day spent pulling data from multiple systems
   - Fragmented visibility across [systems mentioned]
   - Delayed insights (often 24+ hours behind)

2. **Reactive Problem-Solving**
   - Issues discovered after impact (e.g., [specific example])
   - No early warning system for [overtime, inventory, quality, etc.]
