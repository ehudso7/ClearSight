### Template 1: Pain Point Focus
```
Subject: Save 20+ hours/week on ops reporting

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] is scaling fast in [Industry]. As your team grows, manual ops reporting and issue tracking probably eat up 15-20 hours of management time each week.

ClearSight Ops automates that work. Our AI monitors your operations 24/7 and sends you a daily report with:
• KPIs (sales, accuracy, overtime, inventory)
• Issue detection (stuck orders, staffing risks, cost spikes)
• Recommended fixes (prioritized by impact)

Most [Industry] companies save 20+ hours/week and catch problems before they cost money.

Would a 15-minute demo make sense for [Company]?

[Your Name]

### Template 2: Competitor Mention
```
Subject: How [Competitor] cut ops costs 30%

Hi [First Name],

[Competitor] recently cut their operations overhead by 30% using AI automation for daily reporting and issue detection.

They now get:
✓ Automated daily ops reports (no more manual spreadsheets)
✓ Real-time alerts for overtime spikes, inventory issues, stuck orders
✓ AI-generated action plans every morning

The system paid for itself in the first month.

Want to see how this would work for [Company]?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 3: Specific Use Case
```
Subject: Automate your daily ops reports

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much time does your team spend pulling together daily ops metrics?

Most operations managers we work with spend 1-2 hours/day on:
• Checking sales/order numbers
• Reviewing warehouse performance
• Tracking overtime and staffing
• Identifying issues manually

ClearSight Ops automates all of it. You get a complete daily report delivered at 6 AM, every morning, with issues flagged and fixes suggested.

Would you like to see a sample report for [Company]?

## Follow-Up Sequence

### Follow-Up 1 (Day 3)
```
Subject: Quick follow-up

Hi [First Name],

Just wanted to make sure you saw my note about automating [Company]'s daily ops reporting.

Would a 10-minute call this week work?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up 2 (Day 7)
```
Subject: Sample report for [Company]

Hi [First Name],

I put together a sample daily ops report based on what [Industry] teams typically track:

📊 Sales, orders, returns
📦 Warehouse KPIs (pick accuracy, CPH, stuck orders)
👥 Staffing (overtime alerts, scheduling)
🚨 Issue detection (real-time alerts)
💡 Daily action items (prioritized)

Does this look useful? Happy to customize it for [Company].

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up 3 (Day 14 - Breakup)
```
Subject: Closing the loop

Hi [First Name],

I don't want to keep bothering you, so this will be my last note.

If daily ops automation becomes a priority for [Company] down the line, feel free to reach out anytime.

Best of luck with [Company]!

### Response to "Too expensive"
```
Subject: Re: [Previous subject]

Hi [First Name],

I totally understand budget concerns. A few quick points:

**ROI typically happens in < 1 month:**
• Save 20 hrs/week on manual reporting = $2,000+/month in labor
• Catch 1-2 costly mistakes/month = $1,000-$5,000 saved
• Reduce overtime by 10-20% = $500-$2,000/month

Most clients see 3-5x ROI in the first quarter.

We also have a Starter plan at $1,500/month if you want to try it on a smaller scale first.

Would a quick call to review the numbers make sense?

Best,
[Your Name]

```
Subject: Re: [Previous subject]
