## Call Structure

### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)

**You:**
> "Hi [First Name], thanks for taking the time! I'm [Your Name] from ClearSight Ops. Before we dive in, did you get a chance to look at the sample report I sent over?"

**Goal**: Warm them up, gauge interest level

---

### 2. Discovery Questions (5-7 minutes)

**Ask about current state:**

> "Walk me through your daily ops routine. How do you currently track performance?"

Listen for:
- Manual spreadsheets
- Multiple systems/dashboards
- Time spent on reporting
- Lack of real-time visibility

**Key questions:**

1. **"How much time does your team spend on daily reporting?"**
   - Listen for: 1-3 hours/day
   - Pain point: Wasted management time

2. **"How do you currently track things like sales, warehouse performance, staffing?"**
   - Listen for: Manual data pulls, multiple tools
   - Pain point: Fragmented data

3. **"When issues come up - like stuck orders or overtime spikes - how do you find out?"**
   - Listen for: "Too late", "after the fact", "customer complains first"
   - Pain point: Reactive, not proactive

4. **"What's the biggest operations challenge you're facing right now?"**
   - Listen carefully - this is the anchor pain point
   - Common answers: staffing, costs, scaling, visibility

5. **"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your ops, what would it be?"**
   - This reveals their #1 priority

**Goal**: Understand their pain, quantify time/cost waste

---

### 3. Summarize & Validate (1 minute)

**You:**
> "So if I'm hearing you right: You're spending about [X hours/day] on manual reporting, you don't have real-time visibility into [issue], and your biggest challenge right now is [pain point]. Does that sound right?"

**Wait for confirmation.**

**Goal**: Confirm you understand their problem

---

### 4. Present ClearSight Ops (3-4 minutes)

**Positioning:**
> "This is exactly what ClearSight Ops is built for. Think of it like having a 24/7 AI operations manager watching your business."

**Walk through what they get:**

**Daily Report:**
> "Every morning at 6 AM, you get an email with your complete ops snapshot - sales, warehouse KPIs, staffing, support metrics. Takes 2 minutes to read."

**Issue Detection:**
> "The AI continuously monitors for problems - stuck orders, overtime spikes, inventory issues - and alerts you immediately. Instead of finding out hours later, you know within minutes."

**Action Recommendations:**
> "The best part: it doesn't just tell you what's wrong, it tells you what to do. Every morning you get a prioritized list of 3-7 actions, ranked by business impact."

**Show sample report:**
> "Let me share my screen and show you what this looks like for a [their industry] company..."

[Walk through sample report for 60 seconds]

**Goal**: Paint the picture of their future state

---

### 5. Handle Objections (2-3 minutes)

**Common objections & responses:**

**"How does it integrate with our systems?"**
> "We connect to [common tools in their industry]. For anything custom, we can pull CSVs or build a connector. Most clients are live within 5 days."

**"We already use [dashboard tool]."**
> "Great! ClearSight Ops actually complements that. While [tool] is great for real-time data, ClearSight Ops proactively analyzes, detects issues, and recommends actions. It's less about dashboards, more about daily intelligence."

**"Our ops are too complex/unique."**
> "That's actually perfect. The AI is fully customizable to your KPIs and workflows. The more unique your setup, the more valuable it is to have AI monitoring it."

**"What if the AI gets something wrong?"**
> "Good question. Every report runs through accuracy checks, and we include confidence scores. For critical issues, we always flag for human review. You're in control."

**"This sounds expensive."**
> "Let me ask: if this saves your ops team 20 hours a week and prevents one major costly mistake per month, what's that worth to [Company]?"

[Wait for them to quantify]

> "Most clients see 3-5x ROI in the first quarter. Plans start at $1,500/month."

**Goal**: Address concerns, reinforce value

---

### 6. Qualify Budget (1 minute)

**You:**
> "Quick question on budget: Plans range from $1,500 to $7,000/month depending on complexity. Is that in the ballpark you're thinking?"

**If "yes":**
> "Great, let's keep going."

**If "too high":**
> "I totally get it. Let me break down the ROI real quick..."
> [Show time savings + mistake prevention math]

**If "need to check":**
> "No problem. Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
> [Identify stakeholders]

**Goal**: Confirm budget fit, identify decision-makers

---

### 7. Close & Next Steps (2 minutes)

**If strong interest:**
> "This sounds like a great fit. Here's what I recommend:
>
> **Option A - Full Demo:**
> I'll build a custom demo with your actual industry/use case. We'll walk through exactly what your daily reports would look like. 30 minutes. Does [Day/Time] work?
>
> **Option B - Pilot:**
> We can start with a 30-day pilot. You'll get live daily reports, and if it's not delivering 3x value, we part ways. No long-term commitment."

**If lukewarm:**
> "No pressure. Let me send you a full sample report and a breakdown of pricing. You can review with your team and we can reconnect next week. Sound good?"

**Confirm next step:**
- [ ] Book follow-up meeting
- [ ] Send proposal
- [ ] Introduce to another stakeholder
